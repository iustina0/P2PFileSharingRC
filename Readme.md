# Part2Part - Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Application

Part2Part is an advanced peer-to-peer file sharing application that facilitates seamless and decentralized file exchange among users within a network. The application comprises two components: a versatile client program accessible to any user and a robust server program exclusively managed by the system administrator, responsible for initiating and managing the service. Part2Part leverages socket-based communication to enable efficient and secure data transfer.

## Features
